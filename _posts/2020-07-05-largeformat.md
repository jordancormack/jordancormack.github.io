Large format cameras are ones which are designed to photograph a much larger image than 'standard' cameras. The majoprity of large format cameras are similar to that shown below, which takes a 4x5 (inch) photo using film. The main reason to use a large format camera is to get a higher resolution than standard sized formats. As high resolution digital photography has become more popular, large format film cameras have fallen in popularity.

Below is a comparison of a large format camera, compared to the sensor size of an iPhone, an APS-C sensor which is a common size for most DSLRs, and a full-frame sensor which is used for professional cameras and is equivalent to standard 35mm photography film in size. It can be seen that all of these other film/sensor sizes are dwarfed by that of large format!

Old large format lenses can be easily found on sites like eBay for relatively little money, and although using them on a standard digital camera is possible, only the centre of the frame is captured. This is because they are designed for a much larger film/sensor size.

In order to produce an image which covers the entire 4x5 frame, instead of rigidly mounting the lens to the camera, a custom frame was been created to translate the camera around the 2D plane of the sensor. Individual images can then be captured and stitched together using a PC to create a single high-resolution image showing the full 4x5 frame projected by the large format lens.
