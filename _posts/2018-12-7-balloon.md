title: High Altitude Balloon Flight Predictor
---

As part of my MEng Aerospace Engineering course, I developed a tool to predict the flight path of a high altitude balloon throughout it's ascent to burst, followed by the descent of a payload on a parachute.

The tool was not completly finished, although the majority of the method closely follows the results achieved through alternative prediction methods. Although originally created in MATLAB, I do plan on creating a python version for use cases where access to MATLAB is not possible.

## Overview of method

The calculation is split into separate horizontal and vertical components. Firstly, a vertical ascent (and descent) prediction is calculated using a method similar to that created by Steve Randall (link?). Weather data (such as wind direction and velocity) is then used to predict the horizonal motion of the balloon during the ascent & descent.
