title: High Altitude Balloon Flight Predictor
---

As part of my MEng Aerospace Engineering course, I developed a tool to predict the flight path of a high altitude balloon throughout it's ascent to burst, followed by the descent of a payload on a parachute.

The tool was not completly finished, although the majority of the method closely follows the results achieved through alternative prediction methods. Although originally created in MATLAB, I do plan on creating a python version for use cases where access to MATLAB is not possible.

## Overview of method

The calculation is split into separate horizontal and vertical components. Firstly, a vertical ascent (and descent) prediction is calculated using a method similar to that created by Steve Randall. Weather data (such as wind direction and velocity) is then used to predict the horizonal motion of the balloon during the ascent & descent.

### Vertical Prediction

Firstly, the lift force is calculated using the known payload mass, balloon volume and densities of the air and lifting gas. The drag acting on the balloon is taken from the cross sectional area of the balloon at launch with an assumed drag co-efficient of 0.3. The initial ascent rate is calculated from the lift and drag, and is assumed to be costant throughout the flight. The descent rate is found from the drag co-efficient of the parachute, and also assumed to be constant. This assumption is consistent with what other methods use, but is definitely place where accuracy could be improved.

### Horizontal Prediction

Wind velocity components from [GFS data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs) is used to determine the direction and distance the balloon will travel horizontally.
