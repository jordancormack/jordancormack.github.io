title: Autonomous Drone for First Aid Kit Delivery

In September 2019 I lead a team which took part in the [SciRoc](https://sciroc.eu/) Autonomous Drone Competition. The challenge was to develop a drone which could deliver a small first aid kit autonomously, whilst avoiding obstacles along the way, without the use of GPS.

The drone which was developed used an Intel RealSense T265 tracking camera as a positioning system, and a 360 degree laser rangefinder for object detection. A Raspberry Pi was used for high level mission management, and a Matek F405 running Ardupilot provided the low level flight control.
