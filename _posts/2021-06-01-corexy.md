This post is still in progress...

I wanted to design and build my own 3D printer which would let me test new components, and research 3D printer related topics more easily than using a commercial off-the-shelf 3D printer. To do this, I built a CoreXY style 3D printer from 3030 aluminium extrusion, and linear rails for each axis. See below for some initial photos of the working machine. I am in the final stages of printing non-mechanical parts such as mounts for a screen and control buttons, and cable tracks for the loose wires.

More info soon!
