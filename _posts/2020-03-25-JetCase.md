The aim of this project is to create a mobile computer system inside a Pelican Case, based on the Nvidia Jetson Nano. With further development this device could be used as an easily transportable UAV ground station. The main inspiration for this project was [Back7's Off-Grid Cyberdeck](https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit).

The initial idea was to mount the screen in the lid of the case and Jetson Nano in the base, along with the battery and other components. This configuration is shown below:

This configuration is similar to a conventional laptop, however it is not ideal in this example for a few reasons:
* The thicker base is not ideal for typing.
* More cables would need to be passed from one side to the other (e.g. HDMI/power).
* Since cooling vents will be needed for the Jetson, debris or rain could more easily fall inside.

So instead, a configuration similar to Back7's Off-Grid Cyberdeck was chosen, housing everything aside from the keyboard in the larger side of the case.
