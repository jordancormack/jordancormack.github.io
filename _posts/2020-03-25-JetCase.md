The aim of this project is to create a mobile computer system inside a Pelican Case, based on the Nvidia Jetson Nano. With further development this device could be used as an easily transportable UAV ground station.

The initial idea was to mount the screen in the lid of the case and Jetson Nano in the base, along with the battery and other components. This configuration is shown below:
