title: "The JetCase: Jetson Nano Peli Case"

The aim of this project is to create a mobile computer system inside a Pelican Case, based on the Nvidia Jetson Nano. With further development this device could be used as an easily transportable UAV ground station. The main inspiration for this project was [Back7's Off-Grid Cyberdeck](https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit).

The basic components of the sytem at the start of the design process were:
* [Pelican 1200 Protector Case](https://peliproducts.co.uk/1200-protector-case)
* [Nvidia Jetson Nano Development Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)
* [Waveshare 7inch Touchscreen](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7inch_HDMI_LCD_(B))
* [Turnigy 5000mAh Li-Po Battery](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-battery-5000mah-4s-25c-lipo-pack-xt-90.html?___store=en_us)

*Note: These components were not chosen specifically for this project, just from what I had already.*

### Layout 1

The initial idea was to mount the screen in the lid of the case and Jetson Nano in the base, along with the battery and other components. This configuration is shown below:

This configuration is similar to a conventional laptop, however it is not ideal in this example for a few reasons:
* The thicker base is not ideal for typing.
* More cables would need to be passed from one side to the other (e.g. HDMI/power).
* Since cooling vents will be needed for the Jetson, debris or rain could more easily fall inside.

### Layout 2

So instead, a configuration similar to [Back7's Off-Grid Cyberdeck](https://back7.co/home/raspberry-pi-recovery-kit) was chosen, housing everything aside from the keyboard in the larger side of the case.

3D models of the Jetson Nano, the Waveshare touchscreen and the inside of the Pelican case were found on the manufacturer's websites. After creating a rough model of the battery, these were all used to create a basic CAD layout.

A 3D printable skeleton structure could then be designed around these main components. To help protect the internal components from small knocks, foam pieces surround the internal structure, raising it from the inside of the case. Anti-vibration mounts would then be used to mount the Jetson Nano for even further protection. An initial structure was designed and 3D printed for a test fit inside the case.

This prototype internal structure worked well, with the main components fitting well together. A short HDMI cable and a couple of right angle adapters made connections relatively easy. The below pictures show the internal structure.

Eventually I will be using a DC-DC converter to power everything from the Li-Po battery, but I do not currently have one that can supply enough current. Using external power, the functioning prototype can be seen below.

Still to do:
* Design a front plate to cover the front with mounts for buttons.
* Integrate a DC-DC converter to power everything from the internal battery.
* Find a suitable keyboard that will fit inside the case lid.
* Find a suitable USB hub/passthrough to access the un-used Jetson Nano ports.
