title: Controlling a Drone with a PS4 Controller
---

I couldn't think of a perfect title for this post, but essentially it details a method of using a Playstation DualShock 4 controller to control a drone running Betaflight (or similar) firmware.

*Note: this method requires an onboard companion copmuter to be used such as a Raspberry Pi.*

(fancy schematic of everything will go here)
