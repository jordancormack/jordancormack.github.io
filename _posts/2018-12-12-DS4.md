title: Controlling a Drone with a PS4 Controller
---

I couldn't think of a perfect title for this post, but essentially it details a method of using a Playstation DualShock 4 controller to control a drone running Betaflight (or similar) firmware.

*Note: this method requires an onboard companion computer to be used such as a Raspberry Pi.*

(fancy schematic of everything will go here)

### Controller Inputs

To start, the PS4 controller can be connected to the Raspberry Pi using bluetooth. This can be done either through the terminal using bluetoothctl or with a third party gui. Once it is connected, Approximate Enigneering's [Python Controller Library](https://approxeng.github.io/approxeng.input/index.html) is used to get the controller inputs. For this project, only the two analog sticks and some buttons will be used, but the controller library can get the values from the touchpad and internal inertial measurement unit.
