This post looks at my initial testing of Fusion 360's generative design process. These tests will focus on a small 3D printable drone arm, which I initally designed for the [SciRoc autonomous drone competition](https://jordancormack.github.io/SciRoc-2019/). The arm which I previously designed is shown below. On the left there is a mount for the motor and on the right there is a mount to the drone body. A hole was added for the motor cables, which will not be considered for the following generative design study.
