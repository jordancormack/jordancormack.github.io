This post looks at my initial testing of Fusion 360's generative design process. Generative design is an iterative design process that uses artificial intelligence to generate the part geometry, based on a series of input parameters, such as the desired material and manufacturing process - this differs to topology optimisation, which essentially just cuts away regions of the part where the stress is low.

These tests will focus on a small 3D printable drone arm, which I initally designed for the [SciRoc autonomous drone competition](https://jordancormack.github.io/SciRoc-2019/). The arm which I previously designed is shown below. On the left there is a mount for the motor and on the right there is a mount to the drone body. A hole was added for the motor cables, which will not be considered for the following generative design study.

To start the generative design process, the essential geometry was created in Fusion 360.
