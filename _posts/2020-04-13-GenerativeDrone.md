This post shows how generative design and modal analysis within Fusion 360 can be used to help design and develop a 3D printable drone body. For more specifics on Generative Design in Fusion 360, see my [previous post](https://jordancormack.github.io/GenerativeDesign/).

*I am not an expert on Generative Design or Modal Analysis, these are just some initial experiments*

The following electronic components were used for the drone:

### Generative Design Setup

The above components were measured to determine the size and mounting dimensions. An initial preserve geometry could then be created in Fusion 360 as shown below. This preserve geometry will be used by the generative design process as a base to build the body around. In this case the body is 'upside down' as this is the orientation that I want to 3D print it later, and the generative design process can only use the positive axis for the additive manufacturing method. It can be seen that there are four motor mount locations, spaced 110mm apart. The middle square will house the battery, and the bottom plate will be where the flight controller stack will be mounted. Four holes pass through the battery slot to allow access to the flight controller bolts.

After the preserve geometry is done, obstacle geometry must be created. This tells the generative design algorithm wher material cannot be placed. Initially, this geometry is created where the battery, motors, flight controller, and bolt paths are located. As generative design has no way to simulate airflow, four large C-shaped bodies have also been created, to allow space in the generated body for air to flow past.

Each motor is assumed to have around 3N of max thrust with the chosen propeller at 14.8V. A slightly higher load of 5N was applied to each motor mount, and fixed constraints were applied to the inside of the battery housing. In real life, no part of the drone is 'fixed' and the force acts at the centre of gravity - but Fusion 360 will not allow a generative design to run without a fixed constraint somewhere, so this was the most reasonable solution, as the battery is by far the heaviest component. This load case is vastly simplified over the actual loads which a drone will experience in flight, but currently it is very difficult/impossible to input the complete dynamic load case of a drone in all possible flight conditions to a generative design setup. The main force is the lift generated by each motor, and the other forces will be accounted for by a relatively large safety factor applied to the generative design case.

### Generative Design Outcome Geometry

The generative design algorithm was set to generate an 'unrestricted' outcome, as well as three additive manufacturing outcomes (one for each positive co-ordinate axis). The additive manufacturing method outcomes are supposed to be generated in a way which makes manufacturing them easier in whichever orientation the outcome is set to. This sometimes works well, but in this case the unrestricted outcome (shown below) was already close to being 3D printable.

The only change which was made before 3D printing, was to slice a small amount off the base, to allow it to sit flat on the built plate without needing any support structure.

### Initial Testing

Once printed, the components were added to check the mounting dimensions and clearances were all correct.

During the initial flight tests the drone was capable of controlled flight, but there were strong high frequency vibrations causing it to be unstable and the motors to heat up. The high frequency of the vibrations suggested that it was not an issue with the flight software configuration (i.e. Betaflight PIDs). Looking at the onboard blackbox data which was logged at 1KHz, strong oscillations can be seen in the gyro and accelerometer data, starting at around 10% throttle. Zooming in on the gyroscope data, regular oscillations can be seen at around 111Hz.

As it is very difficult to see exactly how the body is vibrating at that frequency, a modal analysis was carried out using the CAD geometry in Fusion 360 in an attempt to understand the vibration and reduce it.

### Modal Analysis

Similarly to the generative design setup, modal analysis in Fusion 360 seems to require a fixed constraint on some part of the geometry. This will result in some modes being present in the analyis results which may not be exactly correct in real life - as instead of the body flexing, the whole drone would just rotate. The first mode is an example of this - it can be seen that the body is 'flexing' about the fixed constraint at the bottom. In real life this mode would not be likely as the would instead just rotate around the centre of mass, instead of an unrealistic fixed point.

<img src="/images/generative_drone_mode1.gif" alt="" class="inline">

The first mode which seems plausible in real life instead of just a rotation about the fixed constraint is mode 4. This mode seems to not just rotate around the fixed constraint has a frequency of 120 Hz - which is only just above the 111Hz frequency of vibrations found in the BlackBox data log, suggesting that it could be the same mode. The real part is not completely solid which would cause it to be slightly less stiff than the solid simulation. From the animation it looks like the arms are flexing symmetrically in the horizontal plane. this is not a suprise, as there is much less stiffness in this axis than the vertical direction.

Below is a table of the first 8 modes and their corresponding frequencies. To me, all apart from mode 4 and 7 do not seem as valid since they mostly just rotate about the unrealistic fixed constraint at the base of the body. As Mode 7 is quite a bit higher in frequency than Mode 4 I will ignore it for now.

| Mode | Frequency (Hz) |
|:------:|:-----------:|
| 1    | 89.48     |
| 2    | 108.1     |
| 3    | 119.2     |
| 4    | 120       |
| 5    | 145.1     |
| 6    | 379.2     |
| 7    | 501.4     |
| 8    | 517.3     |

### Geometry Modification

In an attempt to increase the arm stiffness in the horizontal plane, additional geometry was added between each motor mount. This will of course add weight and drag, but it is mostly just a test to see if it works at reducing the vibrations.

<img src="/images/generative_drone_body_iso_stiffer.png" alt="" class="inline">

Results from a modal analysis of the modified geometry shows the first two modes staying the same, but increasing in frequency by 6% and 12%. The following modes do not look the same as previously, so a direct comparison is difficult to make. The flex shown by Mode 4 is however not present in any of the first 8 modes in the modified geometry, suggesting that the stiffeners should be capable of reducing the vibration which was present in the initial test flights.

### First 8 Mode Comparison

Below is a table and GIFs for the first 8 modes of both bodies. The first two modes look to be the same but the rest are not, as the added geometry has affected the stiffness more.

| Mode | Body 1 Frequency (Hz) | Body 2 Frequency (Hz) |

|   1  |         89.48         |         94.78         |
|   2  |         108.1         |         121.5         |
|   3  |         119.2         |         271.2         |
|   4  |          120          |         326.7         |
|   5  |         145.1         |         343.3         |
|   6  |         379.2         |         392.6         |
|   7  |         501.4         |         395.2         |
|   8  |         517.3         |         420.3         |
