title: Using a Flatbed Scanner as a Camera

This post gives a brief overview of a method for using a flatbed scanner as a camera.

The below image ([from wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scanner#Flatbed)) shows the basic working principle of most flatbed scanners. Replacing the document with a conventional camera lens, and removing the light source which moves with the mirror should allow the scanner to produce images similar to a digital camera.

The scanner I will initially be using is an Epson 1250 from the early 2000s. The first step is to remove the lid and glass, to gain access to the movable light source. The power cable for this can easily be unplugged which is necessary to stop the scanner illuminating the lens from behind.

The next step is to find a suitable lens (I am using a cheap [Yongnuo lens](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yongnuo-YN35-Lens-Canon-Camera/dp/B00W4Z82ZO/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=yongnuo+35mm+canon&qid=1580336807&sr=8-2) with a Canon EF mount). Camera lenses are designed to focus the light at a set distance (to the sensor of film), which for the Canon EF mount is 44mm. A 3D printed adapter was made to hold the lens at this distance from the glass bed of the scanner.

To prevent excess light from entering around the lens, I cut a cover from a spare polyester [drawer mat](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/passarp-drawer-mat-grey-20315966/) I had lying around.

Once the the lens has been mounted to the scanner, it can be positioned to face the subject of the image. In this case I will be imaging another camera on a table.

Due to the age of the scanner, the only feasible software option is [VueScan](https://www.hamrick.com/) which, although not free, works well with this otherwise unusable scanner.

After cropping the preview to the desired frame, an image can be scanned.
