The Standalone Lidar Acquisition Box (SLAB) is a test unit for experimenting with the Livox Mid-70 Lidar. On top of the Lidar itself, an Intel NUC computer, an OAK-D Lite camera, power distribution, and panel mount connectors are included, all housed within an enclosure made from 1515 extrusion and laser cut panels.

The rear of the SLAB features an XT-60 connector for power input, panel mount USB and HDMI connected to the NUC, a power switch, and a voltage display.
