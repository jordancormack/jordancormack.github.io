The Standalone Lidar Acquisition Box (SLAB) is a test unit for experimenting with the Livox Mid-70 Lidar. On top of the Lidar itself, an Intel NUC computer, an OAK-D Lite camera, power distribution, and panel mount connectors are included, all housed within an enclosure made from 1515 extrusion and laser cut panels.
